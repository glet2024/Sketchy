# Sketchy
A simple raster graphics creator and editor -- Implemented with JavaFX -- Inspired by Microsoft Paint

Originally created for CS15: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming. Code is omitted in accordance with Brown University and CS15 course anti-plagiarism policies.

Within the program, you are able to create, resize, rotate, refill, and delete elipses and rectangles, as well as draw polylines. The program is also equipped with standard undo and redo functionality, as well as save and load features that allow you to save your masterpieces to your computer and load them back within the program to be edited.

A video demo of my Sketchy project is provided below:
